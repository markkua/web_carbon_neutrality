    <h4>What is carbon neutrality?</h4>
    <div class="text-body1">
      Carbon neutrality is a state of net-zero carbon dioxide emissions, meaning that any carbon dioxide released into
      the atmosphere from human activities is balanced by an equivalent amount being removed.

    <h4>Why carbon neutrality?</h4>
    <div class="text-body1">
      Global warming, the gradual heating of Earth's surface, oceans and atmosphere, is caused by human activity,
      primarily the burning of fossil fuels that pump carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane and other greenhouse
      gases into the atmosphere.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Consequently, global sea level is rising as a consequence of glacial melt, melt of the ice sheets in Greenland and
      Antarctica, and thermal expansion. Between 1993 and 2020, the rise increased over time, averaging 3.3 ± 0.3 mm per
      year. Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects that in a very high emissions scenario the sea level could rise by
      61–110 cm.
      Increased ocean warmth is undermining and threatening to unplug Antarctic glacier outlets, risking a large melt of
      the ice sheet and the possibility of a 2-meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions.
      Climate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice.
      While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5 °C degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every
      three
      to ten years at a warming level of 2 °C. Higher atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have led to changes in
      ocean chemistry.
      An increase in dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> is causing oceans to acidify. In addition, oxygen levels are decreasing as
      oxygen is less
      soluble in warmer water. Dead zones in the ocean, regions with very little oxygen, are expanding too.

      The science shows clearly that in order to avert the worst impacts of climate change and preserve a livable
      planet,
      global temperature increase needs to be limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
      Currently, the Earth is already about 1.1°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s, and emissions continue to rise.
      To keep global warming to no more than 1.5°C – as called for in the Paris Agreement
      – emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

    <h4>The Paris agreement</h4>
    <div class="text-body1">
      To tackle climate change and its negative impacts, world leaders at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21)
      in Paris reached a breakthrough on 12 December 2015:
      <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement">the historic Paris Agreement</a>.
      The Agreement is a legally binding international treaty.
      It entered into force on 4 November 2016. Today, 193 parties (192 countries plus the European Union) have joined the Paris Agreement.
      <br/>
      The Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations:
      <ul>
        <li>
          substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase in this century to 2°C while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5°C;
        </li>
        <li>
          review countries’ commitments every five years;
        </li>
        <li>
          provide financing to developing countries to mitigate climate change, strengthen resilience and enhance abilities to adapt to climate impacts.
        </li>

        <h5 class="caption">Reducing emissions</h5>
        <div class="text-body1">
          Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is the most straightforward and powerful measure toward carbon
          neutrality.
          One of the strongest arguments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is that it will often save money. For
          example:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Limiting energy usage and emissions from transportation, as well as from buildings, equipment, animals and
              processes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Obtaining electricity and other forms of energy from zero or low carbon energy sources.
            </li>
            <li>
              Electrification: using electrical energy, ideally from non-emitting sources, rather than combustion.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <!--          Reducing carbon emissions can be done by moving towards energy sources and industry processes that produce-->
          <!--          less greenhouse gases,-->
          <!--          thereby transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Shifting towards the use of renewable energy such as wind,-->
          <!--          geothermal, and solar power, as well as nuclear power reduces greenhouse gas emissions.-->
          <!--          Although both renewable and non-renewable energy production produce carbon emissions in some form, renewable-->
          <!--          sources produce negligible to almost zero carbon emissions. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy would also-->
          <!--          mean-->
          <!--          making changes to current industrial and agricultural processes to reduce carbon emissions, for example, diet-->
          <!--          changes to livestock such as cattle can potentially reduce methane production by 40%. Carbon projects and-->
          <!--          emissions trading are often used to reduce carbon emissions, and carbon dioxide can even sometimes be-->
          <!--          prevented-->
          <!--          from entering the atmosphere entirely (such as by carbon scrubbing).-->

        <h5 class="caption">Carbon offsetting</h5>
        <div class="text-body1">

          The use of Carbon offsets aims to neutralize a certain volume of greenhouse gas emissions by funding projects
          which should cause an equivalent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions somewhere else, such as tree planting.
          Offsetting can be done by supporting a responsible carbon project, or by buying carbon offsets or carbon
          credits.
          Carbon offsetting is also a tool for several local authorities in the world.

          <!--          If the total greenhouse gases emitted is equal to the total amount avoided or removed, then the two effects-->
          <!--          cancel-->

          <!--          Carbon sinks are vast ecosystems that absorb CO2. They regulate the climate and stop global warming. As they-->
